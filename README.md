# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this task is to understand the Titanic dataset using *statistics* and *visualizations*. This includes identifying patterns, trends, correlations, and potential anomalies in the data.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## 📊 EDA Tasks Performed

### 1. Data Loading & Basic Info
- Checked for missing values
- Understood the data types and structure

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Calculated mean, median, std for numerical columns like Age, Fare, etc.

### 3. Visualizations
- *Histograms* for distribution of age, fare, etc.
- *Boxplots* to detect outliers (Age vs Survived)
- *Correlation Matrix* to understand relationships between features
- *Pairplot* to visualize interaction between numerical variables
- *Countplot* for categorical distributions like Survived, Sex, Pclass

### 4. Pattern & Trend Analysis
- Higher survival rate in women and children
- Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival
- Fare was generally higher for survivors

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- *Women* had significantly higher survival rates than men.
- *Children (<10 years)* were prioritized in survival.
- Passengers in *1st class* had more survival chances.
- There's a *positive correlation between fare and survival*.

## ✅ Conclusion

EDA helped in understanding the structure and patterns within the Titanic dataset, which is essential before building any machine learning models. Visualization made it easier to derive meaningful insights.
